Take the [datacamp course on joining data](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr) to learn the join verbs.

You will analyze some data in the [`nihexporter`](https://github.com/jayhesselberth/nihexporter) package to answer some questions. The questions will cover methods in `dplyr` including two-table verbs.

First you need to install the `nihexporter` package (and `devtools`, if you don't have it already).

```{r overview, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github("jayhesselberth/nihexporter")
```

```{r overviews}
library(nihexporter)
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)

projects
project_io
```

# Problems

## Problem 1

The `projects` and `project_io` tables have the `r intersect(names(projects), names(project_io))` column in common. Use this column to perform a `left_join` and identify the most expensive project for each institute. Project institutes are in the `projects` table, whereas total project costs are available in the `project_io` table. Note you will have to use the `arrange` and `slice` verbs from `dplyr`.

```{r problem_1, eval=TRUE}
  projects %>% select(project.num,institute) %>% left_join(project_io) %>% select(project.num, institute, total.cost) -> merge.proj
  group_by(merge.proj, institute) %>% arrange(desc(total.cost)) %>% slice(1:1) -> top_expense

top_expense
```

## Problem 2

Create a plot that describes the change in output (number of publications) for the most expensive grant from the above list. Note that you cannot use `n.pubs` for this, as that is an aggregate count over time. You need a tbl of following structure, which you can then use to calculate the number of publications each year (hint: use `n()` in a `summarize` statement:

```{r p2_tbl}
top_expense %>% ungroup() %>% arrange(desc(total.cost)) %>% slice(1:1) -> top_projects

projects %>% semi_join(top_projects, by = "project.num") %>% left_join(publinks) %>% left_join(publications) %>% select(project.num, pub.year, fy.cost, pmid) %>% na.omit() -> top_projects

top_projects
```

```{r problem_2}
top_projects %>% group_by(pub.year) %>% summarise(total.pubs = n ())-> pubs_per_year

pubs_per_year %>% ggplot(aes(pub.year, total.pubs)) + geom_line() + geom_point() + theme_bw()
```

## Problem 3

Use the `projects` and `clinical_studies` table to calculate how many clinical studies have been started by projects from each institute.

```{r problem_3}
select(projects, institute, project.num) %>% left_join(clinical_studies) %>% na.omit() %>% select(institute, project.num, trial.id) %>% group_by(institute, project.num) %>% summarise(total.studies = n()) %>% arrange(desc(total.studies)) -> projects_tbl

projects_tbl
```

## Problem 4

Calculate correlations between `total.cost` and `n.pubs` for each institute. You will need to `join` the `projects` and `project_io` tables to link `institute` with `total.cost` and `n.pubs`. You will then need to use `group_by` and `do` from `dplyr` and `tidy` from `broom` to calculate correlations.

```{r problem_4, eval=TRUE}
projects %>% left_join(project_io) %>% na.omit() %>% select(institute, total.cost, n.pubs) %>% group_by(institute) %>% do(tidy(cor(.$total.cost, .$n.pubs))) %>% arrange(desc(x))
```

## Problem 5 (extra credit)

Correlate [`rcr`](https://icite.od.nih.gov/) values from the `publications` table to one of:

- total cost (overall for NIH, or by institute)
- budget mechanism (e.g., RFA, PAR, etc.)
- type of grant (e.g. R01, P01, R21, etc.). 

```{r extra_credit}
```

## Problem 6 (extra extra credit)

Use [`gganimate`](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate) to illustrate the change in cost of R01s for a few institutes over time.

```{r extra_extra_credit}
```
